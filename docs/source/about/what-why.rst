What is DPG
-----------

DPG is a simple, bloat-free, and powerful Python GUI framework.

DPG is built with *Dear ImGui* and other extensions in order to create a unique
retained mode API, as opposed to Dear ImGui's immediate mode paradigm.

Under the hood, DPG uses the immediate mode paradigm allowing for extremely
dynamic interfaces. Similar to *PyQt*, DPG does not use native widgets
but instead draws the widgets using your computer's graphics
card (using Directx11, Metal, and Vulkan rendering APIs).

In the same manner *Dear ImGui* provides a simple way to create tools
for game developers, DPG provides a simple way for python
developers to create quick and powerful GUIs for scripts.

Why use DPG
-----------

When compared with other Python GUI libraries DPG is unique with:

* GPU rendering
* Multithreaded
* Highly customizable
* Built-in developer tools: theme inspection, resource inspection, runtime metrics
* 70+ widgets with hundreds of widget combinations
* Detailed documentation, examples and support
